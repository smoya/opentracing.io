# Supported Tracer Implementations

## Zipkin

[Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/) supports OpenTracing in various languages via community contributions. There is an experimental [bridge from Brave (Zipkin Java) instrumentation to OpenTracing](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave-opentracing) and a [Go implementation zipkin-go-opentracing](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-go-opentracing). Some of Jaeger's client libraries (see below) can be configured to be compatible with Zipkin backend and wire format.

## Jaeger

[Jaeger \ˈyā-gər](http://uber.github.io/jaeger) is Uber's distributed tracing system, built with OpenTracing support from inception. Jaeger includes OpenTracing client libraries in several languages: [Java](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-java), [Go](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-go), [Python](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-python), and [Node.js](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-node).


## Appdash

Appdash ([background reading](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-appdash-an-open-source-perf-tracing/)) is a lightweight, Golang-based distributed tracing system, originally developed and since open-sourced by [sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/). There is an OpenTracing-compatible `Tracer` implementation that uses Appdash as a backend.

For more details, read [the godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/sourcegraph/appdash/opentracing).


## LightStep

[LightStep](http://lightstep.com/) runs a private beta with OpenTracing-native tracers in production environments. There are OpenTracing-compatible [LightStep Tracers](https://github.com/lightstep) available for Go, Python, Javascript, Objective-C, Java, PHP, Ruby, and C++.


## Hawkular

[Hawkular APM](http://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-apm/) supports OpenTracing-Java and has plans to support other platforms in the near future.


## Instana

[Instana](https://www.instana.com) provides an APM solution supporting OpenTracing in [Java](https://github.com/instana/instana-java-opentracing/blob/master/README.md), [Node.js](https://github.com/instana/nodejs-sensor/blob/master/README.md#opentracing) and [Go](https://github.com/instana/golang-sensor/blob/master/README.md). The Instana OpenTracing tracers are interoperable with the other Instana out of the box tracers for Java, Scala, NodeJs, PHP and Ruby.
